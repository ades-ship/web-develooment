    <p>A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists <sup>2</sup> records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that,<em>adesh</em> once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p>

   
<p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like <a href="#">dissertation</a> in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[10] Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][11] They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, 
    which improved its efficiency by allowing 
    several document certificates to be collected into one block.<sup>[4][12]</sup> Under their company </p>
